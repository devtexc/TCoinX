For example, having it\n * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this\n * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n *\n * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient\n * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.\n *\n * ==== Gas Costs\n *\n * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n *\n * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\n * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\n */\n\nabstract contract ERC20Snapshot is ERC20 {\n    // Inspired by Jordi Baylina's MiniMeToken to record historical balances:\n    // https://github.com/Giveth/minime/blob/ea04d950eea153a04c51fa510b068b9dded390cb/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol\n\n    using Arrays for uint256[];\n    using Counters for Counters.Counter;\n\n    // Snapshotted values have arrays of ids and the value corresponding to that id.

Start a contract from a template such as a token, LP, or NFT contract. Open Zeppelin's wizard may be helpful to start.\r\n1. Import this contract along with Open Zeppelin's AccessControl.\r\n2. Add AccessControl to the contract declarations.\r\n3. Add `address[] memory __disallowed, bool __mutable` to the constructor arguments.\r\n4. Add `ReleasableLite(__disallowed, __mutable) payable` to the constructor modifiers.\r\n5. Add the following functions to the contract:\r\n    function allowToken(address token) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_allowToken(token);}\r\n    function disallowToken(address token) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_disallowToken(token);}\r\n    function lockAllowToken() public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_lockAllowToken();}\r\n    function lockDisallowToken() public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_lockDisallowToken();}\r\n    function releaseAllETH(address payable account) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_releaseAllETH(account);}\r\n    function releaseETH(address payable account, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_releaseETH(account, amount);}\r\n    function releaseAllERC20(IERC20 token, address account) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_releaseAllERC20(token, account);}\r\n    function releaseERC20(IERC20 token, address account, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_releaseERC20(token, account, amount);}\r\n    function releaseERC721(IERC721 token, address account, uint256 tokenId) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {_releaseERC721(token, account, tokenId);}\r\n6. When deploying, add disallowed token addresses, such as the two sides to a liquidity pair, a test token, or a known investor tokens. Example:  [\"0xTEST_TOKEN\"] or []\r\n7. Use the allowToken and disallowToken functions to update the disallowed token list. \r\n8. To make the disallowed list immutable, use the lockAllowToken and lockDisallowToken functions to prevent subtractions and additions, respectively.\r\nNOTES:\r\n - To use Ownable instead of access control...\r\n    1) Replace AccessControl with Ownable in the imports and contract declarations.\r\n    2) Replace onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) with OnlyOwner.\r\n    3) Remove the supportsInterface function, since there are no more redundancies requiring an override.\r\n - There are several other ways to make the disallowed list immutable (to show there is no backdoor for supposedly secure funds):\r\n    1) Set __mutable to false when deploying contract.\r\n    2) Call the lockAllowToken() and lockDisallowToken() functions in the constructor function.\r\n    3) Neglect to add allowToken() and disallowToken() to the contract.\r\n    4) Renounce admin/owner and any applicable roles.\r\n - This is the Lite version of the contract which does not accept ERC1155 tokens, since they can't get stuck in an incompatible contract.\r\n - Disallowing the raw network token will not work. Here are some alternatives to disable their release:\r\n    1) Neglect to add the releaseAllETH and releaseETH functions to the contract\r\n    2) Use access control to create a lite admin role for all other releases and revoke admin role.\r\n    3) Employ the use of wrapped tokens.\r\n*/\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.17; // Solidity must be 0.8.0 or higher.\r\n\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol\"; // IERC20 imported to use IERC20 indexed variable.\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\"; // IERC721 imported to use IERC721 indexed variable.\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol\"; // Address imported to use address()\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\r\n\r\nabstract contract Releasable is Ownable {\r\n    using Address for address;\r\n\r\n    /// @dev Events defined for any contract changes.\r\n    event ReleasedETH(address to, uint256 amount); // Emits event \"Released ETH\" when network tokens have been released, returning recipient and amount.\r\n    event ReleasedERC20(IERC20 indexed token, address to, uint256 amount); // Emits event \"Released ERC20\" when ERC20 tokens have been released, returning token, recipient, and amount.\r\n    event ReleasedERC721(IERC721 indexed token, address to, uint256 tokenId); // Emits event \"Released ERC721\" when ERC721 tokens have been released, returning token, recipient, and ID.\r\n\r\n    /// @dev Internal virtual functions perform the requested contract updates and emit the events to the blockchain.\r\n    function _releaseAllETH(address payable account)\r\n        internal\r\n        virtual\r\n        onlyOwner\r\n    {\r\n        // Releases all network tokens from contract.\r\n        uint256 payment = address(this).balance; // Sets payment to the contract's network token balance.\r\n        _releaseETH(account, payment); // Calls the _releaseETH function with total balance.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function _releaseETH(address payable account, uint256 payment)\r\n        internal\r\n        virtual\r\n        onlyOwner\r\n    {\r\n        // Releases specified amount of network tokens from contract.\r\n        uint256 totalBalance = address(this).balance; // Gets the contract's total network token balance\r\n        require(totalBalance != 0, \"Releasable: no network tokens to release\"); // Throws call if there are no network tokens to release.\r\n        require(\r\n            totalBalance >= payment,\r\n            \"Releasable: not enough network tokens to release\"\r\n        ); // Throws call if the requested amount is greater than the balance.\r\n        Address.sendValue(account, payment); // Sends the network tokens securely via the the sendValue call.\r\n        emit ReleasedETH(account, payment); // Emits the \"Released E T H\" event to the blockchain.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function _releaseAllERC20(IERC20 token, address account)\r\n        internal\r\n        virtual\r\n        onlyOwner\r\n    {\r\n        // Releases all of a specified ERC20 token from contract.\r\n        uint256 payment = token.balanceOf(address(this)); // Sets payment to the contract's ERC20 token balance.\r\n        _releaseERC20(token, account, payment); // Calls the _releaseERC20 function with total balance.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// @dev Internal functions allow external calls to NFT's for transfering.\r\n    function _releaseERC20(\r\n        IERC20 token,\r\n        address account,\r\n        uint256 payment\r\n    ) internal virtual onlyOwner {\r\n        // Releases specified amount of ERC20 tokens from contract.\r\n        uint256 totalBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this)); // Gets the contract's total ERC20 balance\r\n        require(totalBalance != 0, \"Releasable: no ERC20 tokens to release\"); // Throws call if there are no ERC20 tokens to release.\r\n        require(\r\n            totalBalance >= payment,\r\n            \"Releasable: not enough ERC20 tokens to release\"\r\n        ); // Throws call if the requested amount is greater than the balance.\r\n        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(token, account, payment); // Sends the ERC20 tokens securely via the the safeTransfer call.\r\n        emit ReleasedERC20(token, account, payment); // Emits the \"Released ERC20\" event to the blockchain.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function _callOptionalReturnERC721(IERC721 token, bytes memory data)\r\n        private\r\n        onlyOwner\r\n    {\r\n        // Used in the _releaseERC721(..) private function to execute the transfer.\r\n        bytes memory returndata = address(token).functionCall(\r\n            data,\r\n            \"Releasable: low-level call failed\"\r\n        ); // Executes transfer function.

@dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n and the account address.\n NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\n return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this\n function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs.

Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping.

numbers; if this is something you're interested in please reach out to us.\n

We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and total supply at the time are recorded for later access. This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting. In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \\\"double spend\\\" attack by reusing the same balance from different accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism. Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id and the account address. NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract. Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient alternative consider {ERC20Votes}. ==== Gas Costs Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry. There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\",\"events\":{\"Snapshot(uint256)\":{\"details\":\"Emitted by {_snapshot} when a snapshot identified by `id` is created.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"allowance(address,address)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-allowance}.\"},\"approve(address,uint256)\":{\"details\":\"See {IERC20-approve}.
